## Datasets

In this article, we employed two simulated datasets and a real dataset.

+ Simulated datasets: Pavia University and Indian Pines. The data can be downloaded from[Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Scenes - Grupo de Inteligencia Computacional (GIC) (ehu.eus)](https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes)

+ Real dataset: The MSI and HSI data are observed by ZY1-02D satellites. The data are available in Dataset folder.

The details about these datasets can be found in our article.

## Code
The code will soon be accessible.
